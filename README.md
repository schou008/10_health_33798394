## Group Fitness Class Booking System

FitBook is a dynamic web application developed using Node.js, Express, EJS, and MySQL that allows users to browse fitness classes and make bookings online. The system supports user authentication, session management, and secure data handling, enabling logged-in users to view available classes, book sessions, and manage their bookings.

The application also includes an admin interface that allows administrators to add, edit, and delete classes, ensuring that class information remains up to date. Input validation and sanitisation are implemented to improve security and data integrity, while database relationships are used to manage users, classes, and bookings efficiently.
